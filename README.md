# SQL-Examples

The purpose of this repository is to present small SQL examples using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The examples cover/will cover topics like CRUD basics, creating DataBases with fake data, analyzing common example DataBases, working with local and remote repositories, and topics like filtering data on queries, using sub-queries, among others. The repository is still being built, and some of these contents may not be included right now.

**Note:** At this moment we are not including a tutorial about SQL, but it can be added in the future.
